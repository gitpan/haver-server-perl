This is the deep, mysterious Future:

* Add support for SSL.
  This means we have to get SSLSocketFactory working.
  Someone in freenode/#poe said he had already done this.
    * SSL-connected people should have a special (locked)
	  property on them: 'using-ssl' or some such.

* Implement line-length limits.
